abstract: "Drawing on millions of court records of eviction cases filed between 2012 and 2016 in 39 states, this study documents the racial and gender demographics of America’s evicted population. Black renters received a disproportionate share of eviction filings and experienced the highest rates of eviction filing and eviction judgment. Black and Latinx female renters faced higher eviction rates than their male counterparts. Black and Latinx renters were also more likely to be serially filed against for eviction at the same address. These findings represent the most comprehensive investigation to date of racial and gender disparities among evicted renters in the United States."

## Research Question

This paper uses data on eviction filings spanning 2012-2016 from 39 states to document racial and gender disparities in evictions.

## Data

The data on evictions came from Princeton's Eviction Lab. The lab got this data from "court administrative data systems". The data is from 2012 to 2016 and includes data from any county that reported data during this period. They ended up with 3,663 county-year observations spanning 1,195 unique counties. These counties contained 37.5% of U.S. renter households and were generally representative of all counties. 

The eviction records do not include race and gender, so the researchers predicted each defendant's gender and race based on their names. For race, they use the `wru` package in r which calculates the probability of someone being a particular race/ethnicity based on two census data sets: the Surname List and the 2010 Decennial Census. This package also takes into account the racial/ethnic make up of the individual's census tract to generate better predictions. 

For each gender-race/ethnicity category, they calculated three county- and renter-level statistics:

- the eviction filing rate - the number of people with an eviction filing divided by the renter population

- the eviction rate - the number of people with an eviction judgement divided by the renter population

-  serial eviction filing rate - the number of people serially filed against divided by the the number of unique filing recipients

## Method

They present unconditional statistics and use two-tailed t-test to assess differences between mean rates.

## Results

- Including serial filings, there were 1.44 eviction filings across the 1,195 included counties from 2012-2016. Of these filings, 660,000 (45.8%) resulted in an eviction judgement. 

- After adjusting for serial eviction filings, the average renter faced a 4.1% chance of having an eviction face filed against them and 2.3% chance of having a judgement entered against them.

### Racial Disparities

- Black renters were over-represented in the population of renters facing an eviction filing. 

  - Black renters made up 19.9% of the renter population in the sampled counties but 32.7% of eviction filing defendants in those counties. 
  
  - Approximately 4 out of 5 black renters (81%) lived in a county where the share of eviction filings against black renters exceeded the share of renters who were black.
  
  - Black renters are also over-represented in terms of eviction judgments, account for over 30% of eviction judgments.
  
  - The probability of facing the threat of eviction for black renters was 6.2% and 3.4% faced an eviction judgement on average (average across counties). 
  
- All other racial/ethnic groups were *under-represented* in the population of renters facing an eviction filings and eviction judgments.

  - White renters made up 51.5% of the renter population but only 42.7% of eviction filing defendants. 
  
  - White renters had a 3.4% chance of receiving an eviction filing and 2.0% chance of receiving an eviction judgement on average. 
  
  - The average eviction filing probability for Latino renters was 3.6% and the eviction judgment probability was 1.8%.
  
  - Asian renters had the lowest probability of being evicted. On average, the probability of an Asian renter facing an eviction filing was 2.4% and the probability of an eviction judgment was 1.2%.

### Gender Disparities

- Black and Latina women faced higher eviction probabilities than their male counterparts.

  - The average eviction judgement probability for black women was 3.5% compared to 3.3% for black men. Annually, 113,415 black women were evicted, 36.3% more than black men (83,182 evicted).
  
  - The average eviction judgement probability for Latina women was 1.9% compared to 1.7% for Latino men. Latina women also had an eviction filing probability of 3.8% compared to 3.4% of Latino men. The researcher estimate that Latina women face 9.6% more evictions annually than Latino men. 
  
- Black women experienced an eviction filing probability that was 3 percentage points higher than that of white women (6.4% vs 3.4%). 

- Among all renters, "the risk of eviction was two percentage higher for women than for men."

- The authors predicted that 341,756 women were evicted annually compared to 294,908 evicted men. The number of women evicted was 15.9% more than the number of men evicted.

- The gender gap in annual evictions was smaller for white people than for Black and Hispanic People. White women experienced 7.7% more evictions each year than white men.
